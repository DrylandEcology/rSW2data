\usage{
simTiming_ForEachUsedTimeUnit(
  useyrs,
  sim_tscales = c("daily", "weekly", "monthly", "yearly"),
  use_doy_range = FALSE,
  doy_ranges = list(),
  latitude = 90,
  account_NorthSouth = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{useyrs}{A numeric vector. The ordered vector of simulation years.}

\item{sim_tscales}{A vector of character strings. One or multiple of
\code{c("daily", "weekly", "monthly", "yearly")}.}

\item{use_doy_range}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, then the result is
additional daily indices indicating whether the \var{DOY} is within the
days indicated in the \code{doy_ranges}.}

\item{doy_ranges}{A named list. Aggregation output variables and the daily
\code{c(min, max)} of days you wish to calculate the aggregation over.}

\item{latitude}{A numeric value. The latitude in decimal degrees for which a
hemispheric adjustment is requested; however, the code extracts only the
sign. Positive values are interpreted as from the northern hemisphere;
negative latitudes as from the southern hemisphere.}

\item{account_NorthSouth}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, then the result is
corrected for locations on the southern vs. northern hemisphere.}
}
\value{
A named list.
