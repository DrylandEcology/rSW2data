\title{Calculate potential bare-soil evaporation coefficients}
\usage{
calc_BareSoilEvapCoefs(layers_depth, sand, clay, depth_max_bs_evap_cm = 15)
}
\arguments{
\item{layers_depth}{A numeric vector, matrix, or data.frame. Values describe
the lower soil layer depths in units of centimeters.}

\item{sand}{A numeric vector, matrix, or data.frame. Values are sand contents
in units of mass-percentage / 100.}

\item{clay}{A numeric vector, matrix, or data.frame. Values are clay contents
in units of mass-percentage / 100.}

\item{depth_max_bs_evap_cm}{A numeric value. The maximal soil depth in
centimeters from which bare-soil evaporation is potentially drawing
moisture.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with potential bare-soil evaporation coefficients
  where rows correspond to sites and columns to soil layers.
}
\description{
Soil texture influence based on re-analysis of data from Wythers et al. 1999.
Default of \code{depth_max_bs_evap} = 15 cm from Torres et al. 2010.
}
\section{Notes}{
 Rows of soil input arguments \code{layers_depth},
  \code{sand}, and \code{clay} correspond to sites and columns to soil
  layers. If \code{sand} and/or \code{clay} are vectors, then they are
  converted to 1-row matrices. If \code{layers_depth} is a vector, then it is
  converted to a matrix with as many sites/rows as \code{sand} and
  \code{clay} have. That is the code assumes identical soil layer depths for
  each site. All soil input arguments must have a the same number of sites
  and of soil layers, i.e., identical matrix dimensions.

 Influence of gravel is not accounted for.
